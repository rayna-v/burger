# burger

## The Task
Using MySQL, Node.JS, Express, Handlebars and an ORM, I was tasked with creating an 'Eat-Da-Burger' restaurant application that allows users to add names of burgers they would like to eat to the 'Waiting to Be Devoured' side until the 'Devour It' button is clicked and it is moved to the other side. All burgers (devoured or not) are stored in a 'burgers' database.

## Motivation
This app is especially exciting for me as a developer because it was my first attempt at 'Full Stack' development coding the entirety of the backend, frontend, and the database. As always, I like my work to be organized and intuitive while maintaining appealing aesthetics. 

## Deployment
* Live URL: [Heroku]()
* Repository: [Github](https://github.com/rayna-v/burger)
